A meteoroid is a small rocky or metallic body in outer space. 
Meteoroids are distinguished as objects significantly smaller than asteroids, ranging in size from grains to objects up to a meter wide. 
Objects smaller than meteoroids are classified as micrometeoroids or space dust. 
Most are fragments from comets or asteroids, whereas others are collision impact debris ejected from bodies such as the Moon or Mars.

A meteor or shooting star[8] is the visible passage of a meteoroid, comet, or asteroid entering Earth's atmosphere. 
At a speed typically in excess of 20 km/s (72,000 km/h; 45,000 mph), aerodynamic heating of that object produces a streak of light, both from the glowing object and the trail of glowing particles that it leaves in its wake. 
Meteors typically become visible when they are about 100 km (62 mi) above sea level. 
A series of many meteors appearing seconds or minutes apart and appearing to originate from the same fixed point in the sky is called a meteor shower.
